# Lecture 01 â€“ Variables & Data Types (Shradha Khapra)

- JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in browsers and also on the server via Node.js.
- To run JS in a browser, we use `<script></script>` tags inside an HTML file.

## Concepts Covered:
- Variable declaration: `var`, `let`, `const`
- JavaScript is dynamically typed.
- `null` vs `undefined`
- Boolean values
- Case sensitivity in JS
- CamelCase naming convention
- const in arrays, objects, functions

## Data Types:
- Primitive: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol
- Non-Primitive: Object (Array, Function)

## Important Notes:
- `let` and `const` are block scoped
- `var` is function scoped
- Use `const` by default
