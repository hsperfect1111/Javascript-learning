üíº JavaScript Interview Questions (Functions & Methods)
‚ùì 1. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A function is a standalone block of code, while a method is a function associated with an object.

‚ùì 2. What is a pure function?
A function that:

Always returns the same output for the same input.

Has no side effects (does not modify global state).

‚ùì 3. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?
Declaration:

js
Copy
Edit
function greet() {}
Expression:

js
Copy
Edit
const greet = function () {};
Expression functions are not hoisted.

‚ùì 4. What is an arrow function? When not to use it?
Arrow functions use => syntax and do not have their own this.
Don't use them:

As object methods (you‚Äôll lose this)

When you need access to arguments object

‚ùì 5. What is hoisting in context of functions?
Function declarations are hoisted ‚Äî they can be called before they are defined in the code.

üß† Bonus Concept: First-Class Functions in JS
JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens, meaning:

Functions can be stored in variables

Passed as arguments

Returned from other functions

js
Copy
Edit
function greet() {
  return "Hello!";
}
function callFunc(fn) {
  console.log(fn());
}
callFunc(greet); // Output: Hello!
